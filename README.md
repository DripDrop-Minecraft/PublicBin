PublicBin is a Minecraft server plugin, it can help new players survive and reduce the workload of the server.<br/>

PublicBin provides a public inventory, players can use the command `/bin` to open this inventory, they can put useless items into this public inventory, and other players can search for something useful in this inventory.

- Some players will often monitor this inventory in hope of finding “treasures”, this can prolong the time players spend on the server.
